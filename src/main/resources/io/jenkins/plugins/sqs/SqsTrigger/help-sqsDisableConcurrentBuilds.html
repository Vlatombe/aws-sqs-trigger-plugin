    If checked, and there's build running, skip build(s) when message received. <br>
    If checked, and there's no running job but multiple messages are received in one SQS call,
    only the (random) first message is selected to trigger the build and others are ignored. <br>
    If un-checked, each message triggers one build. <br>
